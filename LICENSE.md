### Licensing Summary:

The material in this repository is licensed in two distinct ways as detailed below. The PCB files (all types) and
other documentation and files are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license. 
ONLY the KiCAD .sch schematic files are licensed differently and are under a modified MIT license as shown below.

Although it is not a requirement, you are strongly encouraged to pass on a PDF schematic to your users, should you
produce a closed-source product from these .sch files.

### Licensing Intent And Exceptions:

The split licensing scheme has been used to foster growth and innovation from hardware hackers, while at the same
time protecting the massive time investment of the original author(s). It does this by providing the same very
high-quality schematics under the most permissive license possible, allowing other designs to be freely based on
these .sch files. The PCB design and artwork, however, which is much less reusable anyway, is licensed in a more
restrictive way that's still free enough to allow DIY use by the grass roots FreeEMS users upon which this fine
community is based.

The non-commercial creative commons license used for PCB-related files allows you, the DIY enthusiast, to continue
to modify and enjoy this design as you always have. Unfortunately the practicalities of PCB manufacture don't fit
well with the terms of this license. As such it's important to clarify the intent of this licensing and define
some limited exceptions to it.

The realities of PCB manufacture are minimum quantities and the economy of scale. Therefore it is permitted to
engage in small group purchases of bare boards where the transactions are done under the public eye on the
DIYEFI.org forum, and where such PCBs are provided by the orderer at cost plus postage. If doing an order like
this, you're encouraged to donate some appropriate amount to the author(s) as a symbolic thank you.

The second exception is for the purpose of selling used, second-hand units when you have a legitimate reason to
do so. Legitimate reasons include upgrading of your hardware to a newer version, or different design, and taking
a car back to stock condition for sale. If in doubt as to whether your reason is acceptable, again, please use
the DIYEFI.org forum to ask about it. If you're a sufficiently well-known member there, your circumstances will
quite likely speak for themselves.

Abuse of the above clauses will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
