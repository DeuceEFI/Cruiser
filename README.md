# Cruiser Development Board for FreeEMS

JAG 11/03/2012 1426 EST (GMT-0500)

### Introduction

The name "Cruiser" is loosely based on the SanDisk Cruzer Edge USB flash drive that was sitting in front of me while I was designing this development board.

Please see forum.diyefi.org for the most up to date information and links for this project and all of the other aspects of the FreeEMS project.

### Goals

Core IO specs:

 * 1 FTDI USB (bus powered) communications (USB-A board edge connector).
 * 16 Port A inputs in a pin strip.
 *  8 Port B outputs in a pin strip.
 *  6 Port K outputs in a pin strip.
 *  8 Port P outputs in a pin strip.
 *  8 Port T outputs in a pin strip.
 * Reset momentary switch.
 * Load momentary switch.
 * 1 Ground connection.
 * 1 5vdc connection.

PCB size is to be as small as possible and to be powered by the USB bus, to allow for easy transport for development work.

 
### Status

This PCB is in active development, please refrain from printing circuit boards and expecting them to work.

I will update this status as work progresses.

### Changes

Please send any changes that you make to Cruiser back upstream to Andy Goss' copy at https://github.com/DeuceEFI/Cruiser
