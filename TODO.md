# To Do List

## JAG 01/02/2013 1721 EST (GMT-0500)

### Things left to change For Cruiser 0.3-alpha PCB based on what has been learned from 0.2-alpha PCB:

* Add D shaped pads to allow LEDs to be soldered on/off.
* Make the USB-A pads wider.
* Make the USB-A end 12mm wide, it is too narrow.
* Add 1.6mm plated through holes on the beveled edges to allow stacking multiple Cruisers together.
* Widen all traces to the same width as the MCU pads, the default trace size is VERY tiny.

----------

### TODO Changes Completed:

* Change T0-T3 wire connections to 0.100" pitch header.
